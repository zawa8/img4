Iâ€™ve recently started exploring Deep Learning, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project: Customer Churn Prediction using ANN.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Keras | TensorFlow | Deep Learning Classification
ðŸ”¹ Dataset: Collected from Kaggle
ðŸ”¹ Data Processing: Pandas for preprocessing
ðŸ”¹ Model: Three-layered Sequential ANN

This project was an exciting learning experience, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Looking forward to diving deeper into the world of Deep Learning and exploring more complex architectures!
